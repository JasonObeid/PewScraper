When looking specifically at NPR programming across all stations that carry it, terrestrial broadcast listenership declined somewhat between 2017 and 2018. (Traditional radio listening is “terrestrial,” i.e., coming from radio broadcast towers rather than satellites or the internet.) About 28.5 million average weekly listeners tuned in to NPR programming during the year, down from 30.1 million in 2017, according to internal data provided by the organization.
